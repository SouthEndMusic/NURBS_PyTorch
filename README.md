# About

`NURBS_PyTorch_2` is an implementation of NURBS geometries in PyTorch. The flexible implementation allows for up to 25 inputs and an arbitrary number of outputs. PyTorch offers automatic differentiation so that these geometries are easily implemented in machine learning pipelines.

Interactive plotting is implemented with `Dash` and `Plotly`.
